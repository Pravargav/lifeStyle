## Shift Your Mindset for Growth  

- **Take Ownership of Opportunities** – You deserve success. If you don’t take it, someone else will. *Why not you?*  

- **Balance Giving and Growing** – Help others, but not at the cost of your own future. Set boundaries.  

- **Challenge the “Unworthy” Feeling** – When self-doubt creeps in, list three reasons why you *are* worthy. Your achievements prove it.  

- **Learn to Say Yes** – Growth happens outside your comfort zone. Say *yes* more often.  

- **Surround Yourself with Growth-Minded People** – Stay around those who push you to take opportunities, not those who keep you stagnant.  

🚀 *Realizing the need for change is the first step—now, take action!*
