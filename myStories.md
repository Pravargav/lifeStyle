1) I am from india.when I was in 10th class I am the topper of my school.Later in class 11 and 12 due to lack of practicing and only focusing on learning  concepts at one stage my mental mastrubation went to peaks and my brain has some internal physical damage.Along with that I also had adhd, bipolar disorder and autism.My dream was to get into iit but due to all these things I was'nt able to get into a even basic engineering college.

2) I started taking medication.Do to this my parents have to buy a payment seat in local college.Even in the university with bad friendships, mobile ,p addiction I could'nt get a job even after passing out.I have a dream of getting a high paying job but now I am unemployed.Everything happened unconsciously.I am now 23 year old lost even my critical thinking and even basic thinking skills due to my addictions and medical issues like adhd and autism.I am not yet cured.I don't know anything to do now.If I have followed the practical practing approach in 11th and 12th class this would'nt have happened.Today when I open linkedin or youtube full of success stories of high packages.My medical cases even more complicated due to addictions not cured.

3)I have poor communication skills since childhood and I don't have any friends.My life is very miserable.If god is really there I would ask him why you killed my dreams and health everything.Rather than killing my dreams and health you would have killed me.My collegemates are happy with high packages and friends and everything.Why should I live give me a single reason dont sugercoat.

4)But why should I live .Everyone making their parents proud.But I here ... lost everything .Why only me.I would also have lived like other classmates.Now I am a passedout unemployed.But I can't take what happened to me

5)But every day I am listening to success stories everywhere.It stings.

6)No you are telling lie my college everyone placed with good packages.Our's is tier 3 college.Imagine tier1 and 2 college packages.Where is the people like me who is completely disaster.They might be partially disaster.
