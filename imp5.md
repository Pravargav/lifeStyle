Got it. I’ll **clean, organize, and simplify** this into a **daily-revision friendly Markdown (.md) checklist**, without changing your meaning.
Think of this as your **personal operating principles** — health, focus, discipline, and mindset.

# 📘 Personal Rules & Learnings (Daily Revision)

## 🧠 Mental Health, Focus & Dopamine

* Avoid **YouTube Shorts, movies, and random scrolling** — after ~2 hours it causes **depression, insomnia, and dopamine crash**.
* Spending **2 hours on DSA / Google Cloud SkillBoost** makes me **motivated, calm, and improves sleep**.
* Stop watching a YouTube video **at the very first thought**.

  * 1st thought → easy to stop
  * 2nd thought → difficult
  * 3rd/4th thought → almost impossible
* Never binge-watch **all videos of a channel** just because one video was good.
* Use **“Don’t Recommend This Channel”** aggressively on YouTube.
* Assign **specific days for specific content**:

  * Example: *Tech videos only on Sunday* (entire playlist allowed on that day).
* Avoid **romantic / explicit content** immediately when the thought arises.

  * Delaying leads to escalation (Telegram, Terabox, etc.).
* Surround yourself with **small/local context**, not global/worldwide noise — global context gives **cheap dopamine**.

---

## 📱 Mobile Usage Control

* **Earphones trigger isolation + mobile addiction**.

  * Without earphones → surrounding sounds reduce scrolling.
* Use **grayscale (black & white) mode** on mobile.
* Track **daily mobile discipline** by ticking/checking the calendar.
* One careless day of mobile misuse cost me the **KPIT job** — never forget this.
* Slowly reduce content **like medicine tapering**:

  * 2/3 usage for 3 weeks → 1/3 usage for next 3 weeks.
* Never use **custom ringtones or movie BGMs**.

  * Use **system ringtones only** (clean, decent, non-triggering).

---

## 😴 Sleep Rules

* Read **books for 1–2 hours before sleep**.

  * Results: deep sleep, no nightmares, calm mind.
* Avoid **screens before sleep** — they cause bad dreams and disturbed sleep.

---

## 🧘 Meditation & Mindfulness

* I used **Insight Timer** daily for many months — it helped greatly.
* Meditation + discipline > motivation.

---

## 🫁 Health, Allergies & Asthma Care

* Always **say NO** when friends offer:

  * Cold water
  * Random food
  * Drinks
    *(Boundaries protect health)*
* Always wear **mask + earplugs** to avoid asthma, cold, cough.
* Carry **cotton in pocket** to protect ears in AC rooms.
* During hostel days:

  * Ate only **fruits & juices**
  * **No non-veg**
  * **No sugar/sweets**
  * Result: faster recovery from health issues.

## 🚫 Food Strictly to Avoid

* ❌ Tiger Crunch biscuits
* ❌ Hide & Seek biscuits
* ❌ Parle-G (especially mornings)

  * Causes migraine, left-eye pain, cerebral pain, cough
* ❌ Dil Pasand

  * Severe reaction during Guntur trip → extreme pain for 2 days
* ❌ Station puffs (Katpadi incident)

  * Triggered cough and headache

---

## 🍔 Food Safety Strategy

* With asthma & allergies, prefer **hygienic branded food** when needed (KFC, Burger King).

---

## ⏰ Work Discipline

  * Only **dinner time**
* No unnecessary snacking or distractions.

---

## 🧠 Communication & Thinking

* Use **“Yes, And…”** instead of **“But”** in conversations.
* Think carefully before forming a habit.

  * Once formed, habits are **extremely hard to reverse**.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social Learnings

* Ideal life structure:

  * One **friends batch at home**
  * One **friends batch at workplace**
* Not having a college friends batch severely affected my college life.
* Don’t repeat that mistake again.

---

## 🧬 ADHD & Science-Based Belief

* ADHD is **lifelong** and **genetic** — low dopamine release is **not my fault**.
* Solution:

  * Hard work
  * Mental exercises
  * Physical exercises
* Fewer dopamine cells can be trained to release **more dopamine**.
* Last words of Dr. Santosh sir:
  **“Hard work + mental exercise + physical exercise.”**

---

## 🔬 Belief System

* Earlier: trusted **science and self** → life was stable.
* Later: begging god for everything → life collapsed.
* After 23 years of learning:

  * **God is a hypothetical concept**
  * Responsibility lies with **me**.

---

## 🎭 Fanism & Identity

* I am **no longer a fan of Mahesh Babu**.
* Fanism does not feed me or build my life.
* Responsibility > celebrity obsession.

---

## 📱 Tech & Status Awareness

* Using **Mac → iPhone makes sense** for ecosystem compatibility.
* Avoid Chinese brands (OnePlus, Vivo).
* Pixel vs iPhone is unnecessary hassle → choose iPhone.
* High-end brands (e.g., Lamborghini) target **the right audience**, not everyone.
* Don’t waste money on mid-range phones.

  * Work hard → earn well → buy what you want.
  * Phones & cars are **status symbols today**.
